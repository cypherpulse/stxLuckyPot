A simple Clarity smart contract for a "Lucky Pot" on the Stacks blockchain, designed for maximum STX transfer activity. This contract allows users to contribute STX to a communal pot, with the owner having the ability to withdraw the entire balance at any time.

## Overview

The STX Lucky Pot contract implements a basic crowdfunding mechanism where:

- Any user can add STX to the pot
- The contract owner can withdraw the entire pot balance
- The current pot balance is publicly readable

This contract is designed for high-frequency STX transfers, making it suitable for gaming, lottery, or community funding applications on the Stacks blockchain.

### Data Flow

    participant Contract
    participant Owner

    User->>Contract: add-to-pot(amount)
    Contract->>Contract: Validate amount > 0
    Contract->>Contract: Transfer STX from User to Contract

    Owner->>Contract: withdraw-pot()
    Contract->>Contract: Validate caller is owner
    Contract->>Contract: Get current balance
    Contract->>Owner: Transfer entire balance to Owner
```

### State Management

```mermaid

    [*] --> Empty: Contract Deployment
    Empty --> Funded: add-to-pot called
    Funded --> Funded: add-to-pot called multiple times
    Funded --> Withdrawn: withdraw-pot called by owner
    Withdrawn --> Funded: add-to-pot called again
    Withdrawn --> Withdrawn: withdraw-pot called again (balance = 0)
```

## Features

- **Simple Contribution**: Any user can add STX to the pot with a single function call
- **Owner Control**: Contract deployer has exclusive rights to withdraw funds
- **Transparent Balance**: Public read-only function to check current pot balance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation with clear error codes
- **Gas Efficient**: Minimal operations for high throughput

## Contract Functions

### Constants

- `owner`: The contract deployer, set to `tx-sender` at deployment

### Public Functions

#### `add-to-pot(amount: uint)`

Adds STX to the lucky pot.

**Parameters:**
- `amount`: The amount of STX to add (must be > 0)

**Returns:**
- `(ok true)` on success
- `(err u1)` if amount is 0 or invalid

**Behavior:**
- Validates amount > 0
- Transfers STX from caller to contract using `stx-transfer?`

#### `withdraw-pot()`

Withdraws the entire pot balance to the owner.

**Parameters:** None

**Returns:**
- `(ok pot-balance)` on success, where pot-balance is the withdrawn amount
- `(err u2)` if caller is not the owner

**Behavior:**
- Validates caller is the owner
- Gets current contract STX balance
- Transfers entire balance to owner

### Read-Only Functions

#### `get-pot-balance()`

Returns the current STX balance of the contract.

**Parameters:** None

**Returns:**
- `uint`: Current STX balance in microSTX

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Clarinet CLI installed
- Stacks account with sufficient STX for deployment

### Testnet Deployment

1. Configure your testnet account in `settings/Testnet.toml`
2. Generate deployment plan:
   ```bash
   clarinet deployments generate --testnet
   ```
3. Apply deployment:
   ```bash
   clarinet deployments apply --testnet
   ```

### Mainnet Deployment

1. Update `settings/Mainnet.toml` with your mainnet account
2. Generate and apply deployment for mainnet:
   ```bash
   clarinet deployments generate --mainnet
   clarinet deployments apply --mainnet
   ```

## Testing

The contract includes comprehensive unit tests using Vitest and Clarinet SDK.

### Running Tests

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

### Test Coverage

- Initial balance verification
- Successful STX additions
- Multiple user contributions
- Owner withdrawal functionality
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Access control validation
